> A privacy-preserving desktop tool implementing **k-Anonymity**, **l-Diversity**, and **t-Closeness** models to anonymize sensitive data without compromising its analytical value.

## üìñ Project Overview

This project offers a Windows Forms application built with **C#** that supports practical anonymization of datasets through three industry-standard privacy models: **k-Anonymity**, **l-Diversity**, and **t-Closeness**. It enables organizations, researchers, and students to protect individual privacy in tabular data by minimizing the risk of re-identification while maintaining data utility for analysis.

## üîê Why Data Privacy & Anonymization Matter

Protecting personal data has become crucial in today‚Äôs digital world, where vast amounts of sensitive information are collected, shared, and analyzed daily. Effective anonymization ensures that datasets can be used for research, analytics, or public release **without exposing individual identities or sensitive attributes**‚Äîreducing risks like **identity theft, discrimination, or reputational harm** 
### üõ°Ô∏è Key Benefits

- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  Helps meet legal obligations under GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, and other data protection laws by minimizing exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

- **Maintains Data Utility**  
  Models like **k-anonymity**, **l-diversity**, and **t-closeness** strike a balance between privacy protection and analytical value‚Äîessential for scientific discovery and real-world decision-making.  

- **Trust & Ethics**  
  Builds public trust by ensuring ethical handling of sensitive data‚Äîespecially in healthcare, finance, and social science research.  

- **Mitigates Re-identification Risks**  
  Simple removal of names or IDs is not enough. Combining quasi-identifiers like ZIP code, birthdate, and gender can still re-identify **up to 87%** of individuals
  Strong anonymization techniques are essential.

##  Anonymization Techniques in This Project

- **k-Anonymity**  
  Ensures each record is indistinguishable from at least **k‚Äì1 others** based on quasi-identifiers. 

- **l-Diversity**  
  Protects against **attribute disclosure** by requiring that each anonymized group contains at least **l distinct values** for sensitive attributes.  

- **t-Closeness**  
  Maintains the **distribution of sensitive attributes** in each group close to the overall dataset, preventing inference attacks.

- Load CSV/tabular datasets
- Define:
  - Explicit Identifiers (EIDs)
  - Quasi-Identifiers (QIDs)
  - Sensitive Attributes
- Apply privacy models independently or in combination
- Built-in **correlation analysis**
- Export anonymized dataset
